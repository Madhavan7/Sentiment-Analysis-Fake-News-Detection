# Sentiment-Analysis-Fake-News-Detection

In this project, I trained an NLP model that categorizes news text as REAL or FAKE depending on the contents. This was done using the Transformer architecture - I added a softmax classification layer on top of the Transformer encoder layer. The model was trained from scratch and built using PyTorch, and I used Huggingface for word-tokenization
